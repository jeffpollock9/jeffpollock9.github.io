- The QR decomposition (speed + numerical stability?) and the `R2` prior, see:
  [Estimating Regularized Linear Models with
  rstanarm](http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/lm.html).
- Priors over correlation matrices from [Generating random correlation matrices based on
  vines and extended onion
  method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X09000876). In the
  single parameter case you can also use beta + bijectors, which is quite cool.
- Gaussian procceses, after attending [Principled Priors for Gaussian
  Processes](https://www.meetup.com/Bayesian-Mixer-London/events/262268371/).
- Find a nice example of a use for the new hyperparameters stuff in TF2, see: [this
  github issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/2348)
- Code up some splines from scratch in tensorflow probability, see e.g. [splines in
  stan](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/splines_in_stan.html) or
  try the same methods that
  [jagam](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/mgcv/html/jagam.html) uses.
- Look in depth at the tensorflow
  [LinearOperator](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/linalg/LinearOperator).
