- The QR decomposition (speed + numerical stability?) and the `R2` prior, see:
  [Estimating Regularized Linear Models with
  rstanarm](http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/lm.html).
- Priors over correlation matrices from [Generating random correlation matrices based on
  vines and extended onion
  method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X09000876). Can
  implement a nice soccer example using
  [edward2](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/tree/master/tensorflow_probability/python/edward2). In
  the single parameter case you can also use beta + bijectors, which is quite cool.
- Gaussian procceses, after attending [Principled Priors for Gaussian
  Processes](https://www.meetup.com/Bayesian-Mixer-London/events/262268371/).
- Find a nice example of a use for the new hyperparameters stuff in TF2, see: [this
  github issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/2348)
