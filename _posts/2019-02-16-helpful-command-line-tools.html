If you spend a lot of time at the command prompt then a few tools can really help your
productivity, here are some which I like to use:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix">tilix</a> is a terminal emulator which is very easy to setup and customise.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/riobard/bash-powerline">bash-powerline</a> adds some git information to the command line prompt.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">exa</a> is a replacement for <code>ls</code> (which I alias to <code>la</code>) which looks a lot better</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is a replacement for <code>ctrl + r</code> which reverse searches your command line history
(and much more!).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">ag</a> is a super fast searching tool, which I use all the time instead of recursive
grep.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hishamhm/htop">htop</a> is a much better looking version of <code>top</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop">nvtop</a> is like htop but for monitoring nvidia GPUs</li>
</ol>
