#+END_EXPORT

This is an example taken from https://carl.ac/blogging-with-emacs-org-github-pages.

Here is a table:

| foo | bar | baz |
|-----+-----+-----|
|   1 |   2 |   3 |

Here is some latex: \(\omega\) and then some more:

#+BEGIN_LATEX latex
\begin{equation}
\dot{\theta} \bar{\pi} \hat{\tau} \vec{\cup} \delta
\end{equation}
#+END_LATEX

Here is some code I went and ran:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :exports both :file ../img/example-plot.png
  library(GGally)
  ggpairs(iris)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/example-plot.png]]
