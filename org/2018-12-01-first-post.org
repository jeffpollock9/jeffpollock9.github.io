#+END_EXPORT

This post is for experimenting. Many thanks to [[https://carl.ac/blogging-with-emacs-org-github-pages][Carl Lieberman]] and [[https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll][Dean Attali]]
for providing the main tools for this blog.

Here is a table with a formula for the sum:

| ! | foo | bar | baz | sum |
|---+-----+-----+-----+-----|
| # |   1 |   2 |   3 |   6 |
| # |  42 |  42 |  41 | 125 |
#+TBLFM: $5=vsum($foo..$baz)

Here is some inline latex $\int_0^1 \omega^2 d\omega$ and then some more latex:

#+BEGIN_LATEX latex
\begin{equation}
p(\theta | D) \propto p(D | \theta) p(\theta)
\end{equation}
#+END_LATEX

Here is some =R= code I went and ran which does a plot:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :exports both :file ../img/first-post-ggpairs.png
  library(GGally)
  ggpairs(iris)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/first-post-ggpairs.png]]

Here is some =C++= code:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports both
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
      std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello world!

What more could I ever need?
