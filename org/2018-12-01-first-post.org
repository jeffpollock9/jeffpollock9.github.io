#+END_EXPORT

This post is for experimenting. Many thanks to [[https://carl.ac/blogging-with-emacs-org-github-pages][Carl Lieberman]] and [[https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll][Dean Attali]]
for providing the main tools for this blog.

Here is a table with a formula for the sum:

#+NAME: tab:sum
#+CAPTION: Witty table caption.
|   | foo | bar | baz | sum |
|---+-----+-----+-----+-----|
| # |   1 |   2 |   3 |   6 |
| # |  42 |  42 |  41 | 125 |
#+TBLFM: $5=vsum($2..$4)

Here is a reference to the above [[tab:sum][table]].

Another table to check the reference is right (the taylor expansion is automatic
too):

#+NAME: tab:taylor
#+CAPTION: Taylor expansions of \(\exp(x)\)
|   | f      | n | x | Taylor expansion of order n |
|---+--------+---+---+-----------------------------|
| # | exp(x) | 1 | x | 1 + x                       |
| # | exp(x) | 2 | x | 1 + x + x^2 / 2             |
| # | exp(x) | 3 | x | 1 + x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6   |
#+TBLFM: $5=taylor($2,$4,$3)

Here is some inline latex \(\int_0^1 \omega^2 d\omega\) and then some more
latex:

#+BEGIN_LATEX latex
\begin{equation}
p(\theta | D) \propto p(D | \theta) p(\theta)
\end{equation}
#+END_LATEX

Here is some ~R~ code I went and ran which does a plot:

#+NAME: code:R
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :exports both :file ../img/first-post-ggpairs.png
  library(GGally)
  ggpairs(iris)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: code:R
[[file:../img/first-post-ggpairs.png]]

And then a reference to the [[code:R][R code]].

Here is some ~C++~ code:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports both
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
      std::cout << "Hello world!";
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello world!

You can also run code inline, for example the answer to 1+1 is src_R{1+1}.

What more could I ever need?
