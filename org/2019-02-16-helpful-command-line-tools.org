If you spend a lot of time at the command prompt then a few tools can really help your
productivity, here are some which I like to use:

1. [[https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix][tilix]] is a terminal emulator which is very easy to setup and customise.
2. [[https://github.com/riobard/bash-powerline][bash-powerline]] adds some git information to the command line prompt.
3. [[https://github.com/ogham/exa][exa]] is a replacement for ~ls~ (which I alias to ~la~) which looks a lot better
4. [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] is a replacement for ~ctrl + r~ which reverse searches your command line history
   (and much more!).
5. [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]] is a super fast searching tool, which I use all the time instead of recursive
   grep.
6. [[https://github.com/hishamhm/htop][htop]] is a much better looking version of ~top~.
7. [[https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop][nvtop]] is like htop but for monitoring nvidia GPUs
